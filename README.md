## PTMP

Practical training is an important part of the educational process for undergraduate students enrolled in the College of Computer and Information Science (CCIS) at King Saud University, as it aims to provide them the opportunity to receive hands-on technical experience at a professional environment to acquire new knowledge, improve their interpersonal skills, and get familiar with trending technologies and tools. However, this is considered as a challenge for CCIS students and training committee members due to the complexity of managing this process.





Practical training management Portal (PTMP) system has the ability to help control a process in terms of its planning, organization and management, and since the current training process is difficult for students in terms of searching for suitable companies to apply their knowledge, and Committee members in terms of controlling the large number of students and responding to all their emails, and also organization in terms of offering opportunities to find suitable students to benefit from, so we find it appropriate to use the Process management system to control the progress of the training process, starting with the studentâ€™s search for a training opportunity and submitting the required documents from him, and then starting the training and benefiting from the application of knowledge until reaching the delivery of the final report on the training and the evaluation of the entity responsible.



Therefore, the idea of this project aimed to develop a holistic end-to-end process management system, called PTMP, that significantly helps in familiarizing, standardizing, and improving the current practical training process within the college. The project intent is to transform the paper-based process into an online workflow in which the system will offer user- friendly web capabilities that will act as a communication channel between all targeted users and will integrate several features to serve them.
